# AlternateMe

**AlternateMe** is an Android application (APK) that lets users explore alternate life scenarios by typing "what if..." questions and receiving realistic story-based responses.

Developed by **Or Saban**, the app uses a free API provided by **Deepseek**, which may sometimes result in limited or less accurate responses. To improve response quality, users can connect the app to the **ChatGPT API (paid version)**.
